TCP and UDP Connections:

Create and manage TCP connections using net.Dial, net.Listen, net.Conn, and net.Listener.
Create and manage UDP connections using net.Dial, net.ListenUDP, and net.UDPConn.
HTTP and HTTPS:

Use the net/http package to create HTTP servers and clients.
Handle HTTP requests and responses.
Implement RESTful APIs and web services.
Perform HTTP/HTTPS requests with http.Get, http.Post, http.NewRequest, etc.
DNS Resolution:

Resolve domain names to IP addresses using functions like net.LookupHost, net.LookupIP, net.LookupCNAME, and net.LookupSRV.
Socket Programming:

Implement low-level socket programming with net package functions and types.
Work with raw TCP/IP sockets for custom protocols.
Network Communication:

Implement client-server communication models.
Use channels and goroutines for concurrent network operations.
Network Interfaces:

Query network interfaces and their addresses using net.Interfaces and net.InterfaceAddrs.
Ping and Network Testing:

While Go doesn't have a built-in ping function, you can implement it using ICMP protocol or external libraries.
TLS/SSL:

Use crypto/tls to manage secure connections and handle SSL/TLS.
Proxies and Load Balancers:

Implement proxy servers and load balancers using the net/http/httputil package.
Custom Protocols:

Create custom network protocols by implementing your own protocols on top of TCP/UDP.
